# hello-kubes

This is a deployment of [`hello-kubernetes`](https://github.com/threadproc/hello-kubernetes)

This creates architecture-specific deployments so that we may target them with their own services/ingresses.
This will also make things easier once we have.... stranger architectures (`ppc64`, etc).
