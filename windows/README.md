# windows

These are some allegedly working configs for joining a Windows node to this cluster,
although I couldn't get overlay networking to properly work on the windows machine.

These generally require that you follow the guidelines set out in the k8s docs at
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/adding-windows-nodes/
to have any chance in hell of this working.
